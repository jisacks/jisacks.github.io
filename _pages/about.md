<p align="justify"> 
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Washington</a>, working with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mgolub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Matthew Golub</a>. I'm also a NIH T32 in Theoretical and Computational Approaches to Neural Circuits of Cognition Program Fellow through the University of Washington  <a href="https://compneuro.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational Neuroscience Center</a>. Prior to my postdoctoral studies, I did my Ph.D. in robotics and machine learning with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Byron Boots</a>, drawing from deep learning, optimal control, and reinforcement learning. Prior to transferring to the University of Washington, I was a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia Tech</a>, from which I received my M.S. degree in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. And before that, I received by B.S. in <a href="https://www.bme.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biomedical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Texas at Austin</a>.

When not doing research, I spend my time playing guitar, composing music, and playing the same old RPG games over and over again.

Research Interests
======
<p align="justify"> 
I'm broadly interested in understanding how learning shapes neural population activity in the context of motor control and decision making. My current research uses a combination of task-optimized and data-driven recurrent neural networks to investigate differences in how neural population activity reorganizes under rapid motor adaptation versus multi-day learning. Much of my work draws on tools in deep learning, optimal control, reinforcement learning, graphical models, and computational neuroscience. On the robotics side, my PhD work focused on integrating learned components within the framework of model predictive control (MPC) to improve controller performance and reduce computational requirements.
